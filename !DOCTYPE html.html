<p style="text-align: left;"><i>My Dear Salma</i><br>

<p><i>In every smile, a sunbeam bright,
You paint the world with pure delight.
A giggle soft, a playful glance,
In your sweet joy, my heart can dance.

Your dimpled cheek, a work of art,
You hold the key to my whole heart.
The way you crinkle up your nose,
Is sweeter than the blooming rose.

You're soft as down, yet full of cheer,
The loveliest sight when you are near.
My dearest love, so kind and true,
The cutest soul I ever knew.</i><br>
